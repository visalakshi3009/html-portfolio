        <h1> The Best Movies according to Vaishu </h1>
        <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>
        <hr />
        <h3> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 </h3>
        <p> Honestly, the entire HP franchise is a must- watcher, but since this is a top 3 movies list, the last movie in this sequel will be my favourite. </p>
        <h3> Charlie and the Chocolate Factory </h3>
        <p> Might seem childish, but if you want to get lost in the world of magic and chocolate, this is for you. </p>
        <h3> Family star </h3>
        <p> Funny telugu movie </p>
